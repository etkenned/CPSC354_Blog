## What is the difference between functional, imparitive, and object oriented programming?

### Functional Programming
In functional programming, programs are written as a series of mathmatical functions. These functions all return a value and can be given identifiers so they can be returned from another funciton. This also alows for them to have a high level of modularity. In purely functional programming, the functions are deterministic and there for will always return the same value when given the same arguments. You would want to use functional programming for minimizing side effecs, easier extentions, and maintainability.

### Imparitive Programming
In imparitive porgramming, programs are wirtten as a list of commands for the computer to follow that changes the program's state. The focus of this style of programming is telling the program how to operate. You would use imparitive programming when you want the program to execute in a very specific way and order. 

### Object Oriented Programming
Object oriented Programming is based on creating objects that contain data and code. The main use of OOP is is to design a program made up of intercommunicating objects and classes. Objects can modify their own data using their own code / procedures. You would use OOP when you have a fixed set of operations and want to evolve your code with more classes that use the existing methods.
