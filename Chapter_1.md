## What is Haskell?
Haskell is a purely functional programming language. If you have never heard of functional programming before, all it means is that the language is based on writing mathmatical functions. If you wanted to create an application in Haskell you would just write a collection of functions that tell the compiler what everything "is" instead of telling the compiler what to do. With each program being just a series of functions, Haskell is highly modular and allows for easy maintianability. Along with being functional, Haskell is staticly typed and lazy. A lazy language is one that will only ever evaluate an expression when it is specifically required. This allows for better composability in your designs.
