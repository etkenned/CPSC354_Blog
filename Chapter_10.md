- **Unique normal form** : An object has a unique normal form is there is only one normal form it can reduce to.
- **Normalising** : An ARS where every object has a normal form it can reduce to.
- **Terminating** : An ARS that will eventually end.
- **Confluence** : Objects in a rewiriting system that can be reduced in more than one way to yeild the same result / normal form.
- **Joinable** : Two or more objects that reduce to the same normal form.
- **Equivalent** : Two objects that have a a relationship that is reflexive, symmetric, and has transitive closure. 
- **Church-Rosser** : An ARS where all the Equivalent objects are joinable.
- **Invariant** : A function that that is not effected by the rules of the ARS.
- **Complete invariant** : A function that is not effected by all the rules of the ARS.
