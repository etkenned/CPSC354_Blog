# Chapter 2
## What is Haskell?
Haskell is a purely functional programming language. As apposed to normal functional programming, what this means is that the language is based on writing only mathmatical functions. If you wanted to create an application in Haskell you would just write a collection of functions that tell the compiler what everything "is" instead of telling the compiler what to do. With each program being just a series of functions, Haskell is highly modular and allows for easy maintianability. Along with being functional, Haskell is staticly typed and lazy. Staticly typed languages traditionaly need to have their variables declaired at compile time and not at runtime, however the compiler that Haskell uses in this guide is smart enough to determine the variable type even if you dont declair it with one. A lazy language is one that will only ever evaluate an expression when it is specifically required. This allows for better composability in your designs. Haskell is also primarily based on lambda calculus with will be covered in a later chapter.

## Where do I start?
To get started writing functional programs in Haskell, head over to [Chapter 3](https://github.com/etkenned/CPSC354_Blog/blob/main/Chapter_3.md) and follow along with the instructions to set up the enviroment.
